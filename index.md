Welcome to my page. My name is Tin Wang Wong, people are calling me Tin Wang. I am from Hong Kong, and currently a researcher in microfluidics in France. And in these pages, you will find the summary of microfluidics, with which I have worked or working, and also that I am interested in. Besides, I will give the informations or news in the field of bio-printing, which I have concerned and interested recently. Since I believe, an interdisciplinary between microfluidics and bio-printing could be a future. Last, there are my blog pages, here I will post about my traveling or comment toward social affairs or whatever.
