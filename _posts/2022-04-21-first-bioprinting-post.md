This project was after my master thesis, the target is to use bioprinting technology to create hydrogel lumen on a chip. The method was published in ... . The method is shown in the figure below. Before making a chip, it is required to produce a PDMS surroundings. I used 3D printed mold for this purpose. I will introduce this technology in another article.
