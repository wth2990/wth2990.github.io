Here is my first post in my site, this is the manifest. I hereby will present my schedule of development toward this site. Firstly, I will create the informations of which I have done in the past, like the microfluidics system or bio-printing experiments. Then, I will start to write my blog, day by day. If it needs, I will split "My Blog" part into several branches. The blogs are not necessary written in English, but also could be in Chinese or other languages, which I am learning. I hope this site can help others to learn about myself, and present what I have really done in the past. It is practical for job-seeking, especially the industry of microfluidics.

Enjoy.
